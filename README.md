# Cerebrovascular-Event-Prediction

This project employs advanced machine learning methods to predict the risk of cerebrovascular events (strokes) using health data. The dataset includes key factors like age, hypertension, heart disease, blood glucose levels, BMI, and smoking status, with robust preprocessing to address missing values and outliers.

Highlights:

1. Machine Learning Models: Utilized XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Deep Learning Neural Networks, achieving 85% precision and an AUC-ROC score of 0.92.
2. Feature Engineering: Leveraged statistical techniques and PCA to identify significant predictors and enhance model efficiency.
3. Explainable AI: Incorporated SHAP values to offer transparency in predictions, supporting medical professionals in understanding key decision factors.
4. Healthcare Impact: Aimed at early risk detection to enable timely interventions, improving patient outcomes and reducing severe complications.
5. Technologies Used: Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, SHAP, Matplotlib, and Pandas.

This repository includes code for data preprocessing, model development, evaluation metrics, and visualizations, serving as a complete solution for stroke risk prediction. It is tailored for healthcare applications utilizing AI-driven predictive analytics.
