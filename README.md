# Brain Stroke Predictor


### Problem : 

Damage to the brain from interruption of its blood supply. A stroke is a medical emergency. Symptoms of stroke include trouble walking, speaking and understanding, as well as paralysis or numbness of the face, arm or leg. Early treatment with medication like tPA (clot buster) can minimise brain damage. Other treatments focus on limiting complications and preventing additional strokes.

### Solution:

This Web app will help you to predict whether a person has chances of cardiac arrest or is prone to get it in future by analysing the values of several features using the Decision Tree Classifier.

### Idea: 
Building an application that can predict the occurrence of a cardiac arrest or the possible causes of it by indicating the highly relevant factors.
